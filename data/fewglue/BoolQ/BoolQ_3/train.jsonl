{"question": "are there background checks for guns in america", "passage": "Universal background check -- Currently, federal law requires background checks (through the National Instant Criminal Background Check System) only for guns sold through licensed firearm dealers, which account for 78% of all gun sales in the United States.

Depending on the species, there can be either a single mother queen, or potentially, hundreds of fertile queens in some species.
